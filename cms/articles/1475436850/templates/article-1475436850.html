<h2>Services</h2>

<p>Every application is composed of a lot of subsystems that do different things like logging, data access, caching, specific application domain knowledge, etc. Depending on the type of application that you are building or the framework that you are using there’s different ways to represent these subsystems.</p>

<p>Angular 2 uses the concept of services, an Angular 2 service is a class that encapsulates some sort of functionality and provides it as a service for the rest of your application.</p>

<p>If you have an Angular 1 background you’ll welcome this simplification in the Angular conceptual model: there’s no more service/factory/constant/provider conumdrum. In Angular 2 there’s only services, and they are just vanilla ES6 classes.</p>

<h3>Creating a simple Service</h3>

<xblog-code-panel type="no-header">
  <xblog-code [innerHtml]="templateServices.codeBlocks[1]"></xblog-code>
</xblog-code-panel>

<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>Inject Service to Component</h3>

<p>Using Angular 2 DI to Inject Our Hero Service to the Hero List Component. We inject it into the HeroListComponent via its constructor:</p>

<xblog-code-panel type="no-header">
  <xblog-code [innerHtml]="templateServices.codeBlocks[2]"></xblog-code>
</xblog-code-panel>

<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>Register Services at the Module Level</h3>

<p>With the NgModule decorator in RC5 and the new concept of Angular 2 Modules you can now register services to be used throughout a whole module. You can achieve that via the providers property of the NgModule decorator:</p>

<xblog-code-panel type="no-header">
  <xblog-code [innerHtml]="templateServices.codeBlocks[3]"></xblog-code>
</xblog-code-panel>

<br/><br/>

<p>When would you want to do that? – you may wonder. Well, whenever you want to use the same instance of a service for your whole application.</p>
