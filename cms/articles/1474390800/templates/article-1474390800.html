<p>In our article on <a [href]="references.DIArticleLink" rel="nofollow">Dependency Injection in Angular 2</a> we explored what dependency injection actually is, and how it is implemented in the Angular 2 framework.</p>
<p>In this article we'll take a look at <strong>forward references</strong>, it's an useful feature of the DI system in Angular 2</p>

<xblog-table-content [model]="tableContents">
  <xblog-title>
    <h5 class="section-subject">Table of Contents</h5>
  </xblog-title>
</xblog-table-content>

<h2 id="understanding-the-problem" class="section-heading">Understanding the problem</h2>
<p>Let's have a look at the example below.</p>
<br/>
<xblog-code-panel type="no-header">
  <xblog-code [innerHtml]="forwardRef.codeBlocks[1]"></xblog-code>
</xblog-code-panel>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>It's just a simple example, we declared a service <span xblog-highlight>exampleService</span> then injected it into the component <span xblog-highlight>exampleComponent</span></p>
<p>We guess that you expect the text "Hello World" will display in your screen, right ? But actually, you'll get an error.</p>
<br/>
<div class="screen-capture"><img [src]="forwardRef.screenCaptures[1]"/></div>
<br/>
<p>What's happened there ? This issue is <strong>order of declarations</strong>. As you can see, we have injected <span xblog-highlight>exampleService</span> into <span xblog-highlight>exampleComponent</span> while we declared <span xblog-highlight>exampleService</span> after <span xblog-highlight>exampleComponent</span></p>
<p>If we re-declare <span xblog-highlight>exampleService</span> before injecting it, everything'll work well.</p>
<br/>
<p>So in Angular 2, we <strong>must</strong> define everthing before it's usage ? The answer is <strong>"No, we mustn't."</strong>, this's case which <span xblog-highlight>forwardRef()</span> comes into play.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="forward-references" class="section-heading">Forward references</h2>
<xblog-code-panel>
  <xblog-title>{{forwardRef.sourceCode.name}}</xblog-title>
  <a xblog-source-code [href]="forwardRef.sourceCode.link">full code</a>
  <xblog-code [innerHtml]="forwardRef.codeBlocks[2]"></xblog-code>
</xblog-code-panel>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>What <span xblog-highlight>forwardRef()</span> does is, it takes a function as a parameter that returns a class/expression. And because this functions isnâ€™t immediately called but instead is called after <span xblog-highlight>exampleService</span> is declared it is safe to return <span xblog-highlight>exampleService</span> from it.</p>
